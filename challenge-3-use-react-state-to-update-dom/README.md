# Challenge 3: Use React State to Update the DOM

In this challenge, I had to update data using an `<input>` field.

The main tasks were:

- Use an `<input>` field to accept text
- Update your UI based on that input field
- Use React state to automatically update your UI
- Update data using a form

## Reflection

I was a little skeptical about this challenge because even though I'd seen this before, I couldn't remember how to do it.

After referencing the code in my Magical Movies project (see below), I remembered that `useState` is useful here to manage the state of the `name` and `age`. With their respective setter methods, I added an `onchange` event listener on the `input` fields to change the variables when the person is typing.
