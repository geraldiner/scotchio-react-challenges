# Challenge 7: Fetch a List

In this challenge, I had to fetch data from an API, which was in JSON. Then, I had to display the data on the web page.

The main tasks of this challenge were:

- Fetch data from an API when the "Fetch Data" button is clicked.
- Render details from the data returned.

## Reflection

This challenge was relatively easier than the last one. I even went as far as to load the data as soon as the component is mounted with `useEffect` (I finally found a time to use it!). This is very similar to what I was doing with my Magical Movies project (see below).

I decided to create a `BookCard` component that could be reused wherever needed.
