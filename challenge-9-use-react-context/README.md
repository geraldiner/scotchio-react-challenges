# Challenge 9: Use React Context

In this challenge, I had to create user data containing name and location in context, pass this data to two individual components, and update the data from a separate component.

The requirements for this challenge were:

- Create a React context with name and location data
- Wrap parent component with context.
- Retrieve data in differ components.
- Update data in a different component.
