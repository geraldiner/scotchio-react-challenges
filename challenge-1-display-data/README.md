# Challenge 1: Display Data
In this challenge, I was given user data and had to display it using JSX. The main tasks were:

- Show data
- Bind data to an HTML attribute `<img src=`
- Create a link to the user's Twitter profile: https://twitter.com/chrisoncode

### My Version

## Reflection

This was a good exercise in passing props to component children. It might've been overkill to use a `User` component with such little data, but in this way, I can show a list of Users with a single User component (spoiler: like in the next challenge).
