# Challenge 2: Loop Over Array Data
In this challenge, I was given an array of users.I had to loop over those users using JavaScript's `.map()`.

The main tasks were:

- Use the .map() method to render data.
- Parse and display data in an array of objects

## Reflection

In this challenge, I was able to use `.map()` to display a list of users. It might've been overkill to use `Users` and `User` components with such little data, but it is something I've seen in other projects, such as the [React Task Tracker](https://github.com/geraldiner/react-task-tracker) and Magical Movies (see below). In this way, I can re-use the `Users` component to show the list of users anywhere else. OR if I wanted to just show one user, I would use the `User` component.
