# Challenge 6: Move Box

In this challenge I had to move the position of a provided box upwards whenever a button is clicked.

The tasks in this challenge were:

- Create a state variable to hold the value of the transformation points.
- Handle an event which increments or decrements the transformation points.
- Bind the transformation using inline CSS to the created box.

## Reflection

I can really tell these challenges are getting harder because I had to peek at the solution code.abs

I had ideas about how to approach it, but wasn't sure how to implement it. Maybe because I was thinking too much about `useState` and `useEffect` again.

When I saw the `style={{}}` property on the box, I thought we might be manipulating the `top/bottom` properties. But it turned out that we were using `transform: translate(<>, ^v)` instead. (Most of my bugs ended up being bugs in the CSS syntax ðŸ™‚)

I tried to be _extra_ and use keyboards, but couldn't quite figure out how to do event listeners with the keyboard in React.
