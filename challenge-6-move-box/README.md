# Challenge 6: Move Box
In this challenge I had to move the position of a provided box upwards whenever a button is clicked.

The tasks in this challenge were:

- Create a state variable to hold the value of the transformation points.
- Handle an event which increments or decrements the transformation points.
- Bind the transformation using inline CSS to the created box.
