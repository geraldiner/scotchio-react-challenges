# Scotch.io React Challenges

In my attempt to learn React, I'm going through the React Challenges from Scotch.io, and saving my work in this repository.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

Since I'm focusing on learning React that is the priority in these projects. Generally, I'll use the provided starter code which has HTML and CSS already included. It's just a matter of knowing which `class`es, `id`s and tags to use.

## Lessons Learned

I've been so used to using the shortcuts in VS Code that when I was working in the provided Code Sandbox starter code, I didn't know how to write out the functional components. I'd always relied on the `rafce` shortcut.

I really learned a lot about `useContext`, especially with the last challenge. I'd never heard of it, so I spent some time researching it and getting a better understanding of it. It provides such a better way to make "global" `props` to use in any other component.

I wasn't really confident in my React abilities beforehand, but these were really beginner friendly and solidified my understanding of how to use React and create React components. I'm excited to learn more about React Context and use it in my own projects.
