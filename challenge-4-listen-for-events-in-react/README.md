# Challenge 4: Listen for Events in React

In this challenge, I had to create a form which receives input data and alerts the window when a specific word is typed in.

The main tasks of this challenge were:

- Store form data in state.
- Display alert if a particular word is entered into the form.

## Reflection

I thought this challenge was a good place to use `useEffect`, but the solution ended up simpler than that. The check for if the 'password' was typed in could just be written into the component itself instead of something like `useEffect`. I used the simpler logic for `onChange` from the last challenge and implemented it into the `input` tag itself instead of in a separate helper function.
