# Challenge 8: Recreate Layout with Components

In this challenge I had an empty function, which served as a child component. This component received props of an icon, label and number, and I needed to display components for each of the data.

The main tasks of this challenge were:

- Define the child component in JSX.
- Define props of icon, label and number in the child component.
- Use the child component numerous times in the provided parent component and pass in varying data as props.
