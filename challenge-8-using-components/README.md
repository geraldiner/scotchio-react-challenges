# Challenge 8: Recreate Layout with Components

In this challenge I had an empty function, which served as a child component. This component received props of an icon, label and number, and I needed to display components for each of the data.

The main tasks of this challenge were:

- Define the child component in JSX.
- Define props of icon, label and number in the child component.
- Use the child component numerous times in the provided parent component and pass in varying data as props.

## Reflection

This was a lot easier than I thought. A couple challenges ago, I thought the challenges were getting progressively more difficult, but this is something I've been doing already: creating components for repeated pieces (eg. the `BookCard` component in the last challenge).

But I did learn a new method, `Number.toLocaleString()`, which put the commas in the right place for the numbers.
