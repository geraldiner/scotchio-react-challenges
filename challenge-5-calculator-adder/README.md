- Store input numbers
- Add numbers

## Reflection
At first look, this challenge seemed a bit tricky. I think I might've been wary because trying to do this with VanillaJS to make an actual calculator with keyboard input was a lot more difficult.

But it was just a simple example of `useState` for multiple variables. There was one for the first number, the second number, and the answer. 

The original problem was set up to only handle addition, but for "bonus points" I also included the other arithmetic operator and it was just as easy as setting up more buttons and more functions. If I wanted to be less redundant, there would be only one function with maybe a `switch` statement that takes in the operator as an argument to decide which operation to perform on the given numbers.
