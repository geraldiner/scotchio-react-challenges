# Challenge 5: Calculator Adder

In this challenge, there are two numbers from an input element and the app should add both numbers. Then, the app should display the sum of these numbers on the same page. The main tasks of this challenge were:

- Store input numbers
- Add numbers
- Display the sum on the page

## Reflection

At first look, this challenge seemed a bit tricky. I think I might've been wary because trying to do this with VanillaJS to make an actual calculator with keyboard input was a lot more difficult.

But it was just a simple example of `useState` for multiple variables. There was one for the first number, the second number, and the answer.

The original problem was set up to only handle addition, but for "bonus points" I also included the other arithmetic operator and it was just as easy as setting up more buttons and more functions. If I wanted to be less redundant, there would be only one function with maybe a `switch` statement that takes in the operator as an argument to decide which operation to perform on the given numbers.
